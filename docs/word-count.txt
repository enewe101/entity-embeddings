\section{Introduction}
The extraction of relations is a fundamental aspect of natural language
understanding, playing a central role in knowledge base construction, question
answering, and recognizing textual entailment.
It is well known that semantic relations can be expressed via a syntactically
diverse set of constructions. Consider the following statements which are
approximate paraphrases:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(1\alph*)},noitemsep]
\item Jack \textbf{befriended} Jill 5 years ago.
\item Jack and Jill's \textbf{friendship} is now 5 years old.
\item Jack has been Jill's \textbf{friend} for 5 years.
\end{enumerate}

Whereas \textbf{(1a)} establishes the relation by means of a verb,
\textbf{(1b)} and \textbf{(1c)} do so by means of nouns. In example
\textbf{(1c)}, ``friend'' is part of a semantically motivated class of nouns
called \textit{relational nouns}, a class we will focus on in this work.

Relational nouns are nouns that identify an entity by virtue of how it relates
to something else \cite{barker2011possessives}. In the above example,
``friend'' establishes a relation between its referent, Jack, and the external
entity, Jill, which could be depicted using a two-place predicate such as
\texttt{friend(Jack, Jill)}. This differs from how a sortal (i.e.,
non-relational) noun like ``person'' is interpreted.  The sentence
\textit{Jill is a person} could be depicted as a unary predicate,
\texttt{person(Jill)}. In other words, there is an absolute set of scientists,
but there is no absolute set of friends, without first specifying the person
with whom they are friends.

Identifying relational nouns is a prerequisite for building a correct semantic
interpretation of a sentence. While they behave syntactically like other nouns,
semantically, they often behave as two-place predicates, as shown above.
Semantic parsers such as Boxer that are trained on CCGBank do not currently
distinguish between relational and non-relational nouns, leading to errors in
sentences that contain them \cite{bos2008wide}.  Relation extraction systems
such as \textsc{ReNoun} \cite{yahya2014renoun} and \textsc{RelNoun}
\cite{pal2016demonyms} rely on automatically extracted patterns, and also do
not make a distinction between relational and non-relational nouns.  
Various information extraction systems could be improved by the identification
of relational nouns. In this work, we approach the creation of a high-quality
lexicon of relational nouns, using bootstrapped manual annotation.

The definition of relational nouns is difficult to apply in practice during
annotation, in part because the meaning of most nouns involves some relation at
least indirectly. Part of our contribution is a series of decisions about what
should be included or excluded from the class; decisions which are made with
applications to relation extraction in mind. We describe these decisions and
the approach to annotation. 

Based on our annotation results, approximately one out of every 15 nouns, by
type, is relational. While this represents a substantial semantic class, it
nevertheless means that a significant amount of annotation effort will be
expended on annotating the negative class. To more efficiently deploy
annotation effort, we use a classifier to select candidate nouns in a
bootstrapping process. 

We obtain a dataset of 5,832 labelled nouns. Among these nouns, 1,358 are
labelled as relational 
%(862) or partly relational (496), 
with the remaining 4,501 labelled non-relational.

In addition to the dataset, we obtain a classifier capable of achieving 0.71 F1
when classifying held-out nouns from the top 2,500 most common nouns, and 0.45
F1 from nouns chosen uniformly at random. The dataset and classifier are
released to the scientific community so they can be used to augment relation
extraction systems and in other NLP applications.

\section{Related work}
There exists a line of work examining the properties of relational nouns using
a formal theoretical framework
\cite{de1988interpretation,partree2008genitives,laczko2009relational,barker2011possessives}.
There, the focus is on developing a consistent theoretical treatment rather
than lexical resources.  Many of our decisions and heuristics used in
annotation and classification are based on this literature.

Other work focuses on the development of resources and systems for nominal
semantics, which is complementary to our work. This includes NomBank
\cite{meyers2004nombank}, and other work on nominal semantic role labelling
\cite{pado2008semantic,gerber2010beyond}. These resources and systems are
concerned with the argument structure of nouns. Relational nouns are often
treated as taking arguments, so this overlaps somewhat with our work, but these
resources do not focus on relational nouns in particular. NomBank, by its
extension to NomLex \cite{macleod1998nomlex}, does include a short list of 331
nouns identified as relational. By focusing specifically on relational nouns,
we generate a lexicon with a greater than fourfold increase in relational nouns
(1,358).   
Within the context of Open Information Extraction, earlier work such as ReVerb
focused on extracting relations from verbs \cite{fader2011identifying}.
\newcite{mausam2012open} examined the role of nouns and adjectives as bearers
of predicates as well, showing that doing so increases coverage.
\newcite{yahya2014renoun} developed the \textsc{ReNoun} system, which focuses
on extracting information about rarer attributes expressed using nouns.

The work most related to our work is the \textsc{RelNoun} Open IE system, most
recently augmented by \newcite{pal2016demonyms}. This work extracts relations
expressed using nouns, including relational nouns, using a combination of
deterministic patterns and lexical resources, yielding 209 correct extractions
from 2,000 newswire sentences. 

Our current work complements automated extraction systems like \textsc{ReNoun}
and \textsc{RelNoun} by assembling a lexicon of relational nouns. Rather than
only relying on automatically extracted patterns, we use manual annotation and
bootstrapping to create a high-quality lexicon. This lexicon of relational
nouns can be used as a semantic resource in various applications, including
relation extraction systems.

\caption{Relational noun examples drawn from the literature
\cite{lichtenberk2011interpretation,partree2008genitives,laczko2009relational,Cresswell1996,de1988interpretation,barker2011possessives,Asudeh2005,partee2003genitives},
grouped by subclass, along with additional examples we provide.  Superscripts
indicate the number of distinct authors that used the noun as an example.  The
nouns which we consider relational under our operationalization are shown in
bold, with a dagger  ($\dagger$) indicating that the noun also has a prominent
non-relational meaning(s).}
\label{table:relnouns}
\end{table*}

Our operationalization of relational nouns follows the theoretical treatment in
the context of possessive constructs (see
section~\ref{sec:existing-treatments}) fairly closely. However, we deviate in
certain cases (as will be noted) due to an interest in prioritizing relation
extraction applications.

Applying the definition of relational nouns during annotation is quite
difficult, in part because relational nouns carry no strong syntactic
characteristics that distinguish them. It helps to decompose the definition of
relational nouns into two criteria: 
(1) relational nouns must provide intrinsic lexical evidence that a relation is
being expressed, and (2) relational nouns must refer to one of the members in
the relationship expressed.  

Notice that this is equivalent to the definition already given: a relational
noun identifies an entity by virtue of how it relates to something else. This
decomposition shows that there are fundamentally two ways that a noun can fail
to be relational. 

Sortal nouns such as \textit{car} are eliminated by criterion 1, even though
they participate in relations in a way that is often grammatically
indistinguishable from relational nouns.  This is best illustrated by example.
In the sentences \textit{that is Jill's car} and \textit{Jack is Jill's
brother}, we see the referents of \textit{car} and \textit{brother} (Jack) both
participating in respective relations. However, if Jill utters the sentence
\textit{Jack is a brother} she probably means \texttt{brother(Jack, Jill)},
whereas uttering \textit{that is a car} does not indicate a corresponding
relation.

Criterion 2 eliminates nouns that indicate relationships yet which are not
relational nouns. For example, event and result nominals such as
\textit{disagreement} and \textit{reconciliation}, refer to the relation
itself, not one of the participants.  So too do nouns like \textit{friendship}.
Note that agent and patient deverbal nouns, such as \textit{employee} and
\textit{employer} adhere to criterion 2.

To further clarify the boundaries of what will be considered relational, we
collected a large number of examples of relational nouns given in semantic
theoretical literature, and organized them into a typology based on the kind of
relation expressed, see 
\textbf{Table \ref{table:relnouns}}. This allows us to structure and simplify
the annotation task.  By learning each of the relational noun subclasses, the
annotator can decide whether a candidate noun is relational by considering
whether it belongs to any of the accepted subclasses.  We now review the
subclasses chosen for inclusion below.

\paragraph{Kinship.} Kinship nouns like \textit{brother} or \textit{aunt},
describe family relations.  Kinship nouns are comparatively easy to identify,
and are the most common  example in the literature.

\paragraph{Social non-kin.} These nouns depict social roles which are not
family relations, including informal roles, like \textit{friend}, and formal or
organizational roles like \textit{mayor}, \textit{CEO}, or \textit{goalie}.
Nouns that depict roles without any inherent relational affiliation, such as
\textit{butcher} are excluded.  %Nouns with relational and non-relational uses
are included., for example, \textit{teacher} can indicate a pupil-teacher
relationship (\textit{he is my teacher}) or simply refer to the vocation
(\textit{he has been a teacher for 10 years}).

\paragraph{Operational.} These nouns indicate non-social relations, such as
cause/effect, function, purpose, and representation.  Semantic theory
describing possessive constructs dictates that relational nouns can occupy
postnominal possessive construction (see
section~\ref{sec:existing-treatments}), but we include some nouns in this
subclass that cannot. For example, we include \textit{cure}; even though it is
more natural to say \textit{the cure for the disease}, than to use the
postnominal possessive, \textit{the cure of the disease}.  

\paragraph{Relative parts.} This subclass includes nouns that designate a
physical region based on a spatial or temporal relationship to a whole,
including examples like \textit{edge} and \textit{intro}.  
Unlike other relational nouns, these are typically reified by the relation
itself: the corner of a desk exists by virtue of being the corner---it cannot
exist apart from its relation to the desk.

\vspace{5mm}
The union of these four subclasses, \textit{kinship}, \textit{social non-kin},
\textit{operational}, and \textit{relative part}, constitute our definition of
relational nouns.  

We specifically exclude two subclasses that contain nouns normally considered
relational in the context of theoretical discussions of possessive constructs:

\paragraph{Body parts.}  All body part nouns are considered to be relational
\cite{laczko2009relational}. While this classification may be convenient for
semantic theory, body part nouns provide weak evidence at the lexical level of
a specific relationships, so we consider them eliminated by criterion 1.
However, we do include body parts that have an alternative sense that falls
under an accepted subclass, e.g. \textit{head} as in \textit{head of the
department} or \textit{leg} as in \textit{leg of the journey}. 

\paragraph{Properties.} Nouns such as \textit{height}, or \textit{colour} are
also treated as relational nouns, but we draw a distinction between nouns that
identify the properties of individual entities and nouns that establish
relationships \textit{between} entities (hence we consider properties
eliminated by criterion 1).  Properties are useful for information extraction,
but we consider them to warrant a separate effort (in part undertaken in
\cite{de1988interpretation}).

\vspace{5mm}

%In addition to nouns that are theoretically treated as relational, we note
that there are ways of expressing relations using non-relational nouns, which
we group into two additional subclasses:
%
%\paragraph{Acts.} These are deverbal nouns, including event (or process)
nominals and result nominals, that retain relational meaning of their verb
form, for example \textit{disagreement} and \textit{reconciliation}.  Note that
unlike relational nouns, which refer to one of the entities involved in the
relation, these nouns refer to the relation itself, hence they fail criterion
2. Prior work has treated these nouns [cite Joice Chi's work that looked at
event nominals].  We do not include all deverbal nouns in this class: agent or
patient deverbal nouns (\textit{employee}, \textit{employer}) should be classed
under social non-kin or operational nouns, and are relational according to our
classification.
%
%\paragraph{Linkages.} Linkages refer directly to relationships as static
structures, for example \textit{friendship}.  Like acts, they differ from
relational nouns in that they refer to the relation, not one of the entities
involved in the relation, and so fail criterion 2.

Note that, provided one accepts that body part nouns and properties are not
relational, the four included subclasses are exhaustive, for the trivial reason
that the operational subclass can absorb any relation that is non-social and
non-spatio-temporal.  In that respect it functions as a catch-all.

\subsection{Annotation}
The two criteria introduced in the previous section are central concepts in the
annotation guidelines.  We also collect a large number of examples for the four
subclasses considered to be relational (\textit{kinship}, \textit{social
non-kin}, \textit{operational}, and \textit{relative part}).

We conducted annotation using three experts (natural language processing and
linguistics researchers) and 13 non-experts.
To train annotators, we rely on a large number of examples, selected by the
experts prior to annotation.  In an initial training phase, annotators annotate
examples from each subclass, and receiving immediate feedback.  Then annotators
must complete 25 test examples and annotate at least 70\% correctly.  Test
examples are also inserted throughout the annotations, and annotators must
maintain this proportion of correct answers for their data to be used.

Due to polysemy, many nouns have relational and non-relational meanings.  Since
this resource is meant to be an input for NLP systems, we adopt a
recall-oriented stance, and consider a noun to be relational if any of its
meanings are relational.  However, during annotation, we distinguish between
nouns whose primary meaning is relational, and those having a subordinate
relational sense.  Specifically, annotators are instructed to label a noun as
``usually relational'' if, in their estimation, a relational sense of the noun
applies to strictly more than half of its occurrences.  
Nouns having relational senses that do not account for the majority of
occurrences were to be labelled ``occasionally relational'', while nouns
lacking any intrinsic relational sense were to be labelled ``almost never
relational''.

Multiple annotations of the same noun were combined as follows.  If, for a
given noun, one of the labels was applied in strict majority, that label was
accepted as final.  If no single label was in strict majority, the noun was
classified as partly relational.

For the purposes of bootstrapping and classification, we consider both
``occasionally relational'' and ``usually relational'' to constitute the
positive class of relational nouns.  However, we preserve the distinction
between ``usually relational'' and ``occasionally relational'' in the final
dataset since it may be of use to NLP systems.

Interested readers can access a complete reproduction of the annotation
guidelines\footnote{[Redacted to preserve anonymity]}.

\subsubsection{Annotator pool}
We used a combination of three expert coders and 13 non-expert coders to
annotate 5,832 nouns.  A subset of 250 nouns was annotated by all expert and
non-expert participants to measure agreement.
Agreement (Krippendorff's $\alpha$, squared error metric) was 0.53 among expert
annotators and 0.47 among non-expert participants.  
%The class for a word was taken to be the mode annotation, unless there was a
tie between classes, in which case the noun was labeled as occasionally
relational.

One expert and the non-expert annotators annotated the remainder of the nouns.
Each noun was either labeled by the expert or the participant annotators.
Nouns labeled by participants were annotated by at least three annotators, and
up to five if the initial labels were not unanimous.  Final labels for the 250
nouns annotated by both experts and non-experts were based on the experts'
annotations.

\subsection{Bootstrapping}
Our approach to annotation reflected a balance between a desire to cover common
words, and to discover as many relational nouns as possible overall, while
still obtaining data for rare phenomena.

To achieve this, we used a bootstrapping approach.  We began with a seed set of
expert-annotated nouns.  These included the examples collected from the
literature (\textbf{Table \ref{table:relnouns}}), and additional examples found
by sampling nouns from Gigaword \cite{citeulike:4789716}.  During each
iteration,  we trained a model based on the existing annotations, and
oversampled nouns predicted by the classifier to be relational.  In each round,
we also included a sample from the most common nouns (based on occurrence in
Gigaword) and a uniform random sample over token types.  
The nouns selected by the classifier were enriched in relational nouns by a
factor of 8, being 49.8\% relational. To avoid biasing subsequent models, we
included some nouns predicted to be non-relational in each round of annotation.

Three rounds of annotation, each consisting of approximately 2,000 nouns, were
performed.

\section{Relational noun detection}
In this section, we describe the classifiers that we built for automatically
detecting relational nouns, used to bootstrap the annotation process.  After
annotation was complete, we optimized a classifier based on held out dev and
test sets.  The output from the decision function of this classifier can be
used to provide a ``relationalness'' score on unannotated nouns. 

As mentioned, the annotations provide three-class labels: ``usually
relational'', ``occasionally relational'', and ``almost never relatoinal''.
But for the purpose of building and testing our classifiers, we collapse
``usually relational'' and ``occasionally relational'' into a single positive
class.  This is based on the idea that the classification of a noun would be
used as an input feature to an information extraction system.  Keeping the
feature recall-oriented allows the information extraction system to refine
precision based on other features. 

Because we are interested in 
using the classifier both for bootstrapping and for classification of
unannotated nouns, we report two evaluation metrics: the average precision, and
the F1 score.  During bootstrapping, we are less interested in the absolute
prediction of the classifier, and more interested in which nouns are ranked as
the ``most relational'' by the classifier's decision function.  Average
precision provides a measure of the performance of the ranking provided by the
classifier's decision function, while F1 provides a measure of the binary
prediction recall and precision.


One can expect that automatically detecting relational nouns is quite
difficult, given 
(a) relational nouns behave grammatically the same way as sortal nouns, (b) the
annotation of relational nouns is quite difficult even for people, and (c) even
when merging the ``usually relational'' and ``occasionally relational''
classes, there are far more negative than positive examples.

\subsection{Baseline}
To construct a baseline classifier, we draw on the observation of
\newcite{barker2011possessives} that relational nouns characteristically arise
under the possessive constructs, such as the prenominal (\textit{Jill's
brother}) and the postnominal (\textit{the brother of Jill}) constructions.
Using the Gigaword \cite{citeulike:4789716} corpus, we collect counts for the
number of times a given word appears in the prenominal and postnominal
constructions, as a fraction of total occurrences, and use this feature in a
support vector machine (SVM).

\subsection{Feature engineering}
To create a more performant classifier, we add the following features:

\paragraph{Dependency tree features.} For each noun, we note the frequency with
which it arises in particular dependency tree contexts.  We encode the
dependency tree context as follows.  Starting from the word, we follow
dependency tree links for up to three hops, noting the sequence of dependency
relations, direction of the relations, and the part of speech (POS) tags of the
nodes.  A count is recorded for each such path, for each occurrence of a lemma.

Dependency tree features were based on statistics gathered from parsing English
Gigaword \cite{citeulike:4789716} with the CoreNLP dependency parser
\cite{manning-EtAl:2014:P14-5}, considering only occurrences where the token is
a noun according to CoreNLP's part-of-speech tagger.

\paragraph{Sequence features.} For each noun, we record counts for the POS,
lemma, and surface form, and bigrams thereof, of the surrounding 10 tokens
along with their relative position.

\paragraph{Morphological features.} We record the suffix of the token, based on
a list of common suffixes (see supplementary material).

\paragraph{Derivational features.}  We record when nouns are related
derivationally to other words. For each such case, we record the related word's
POS based on WordNet's \texttt{derivationally\_related\_forms}
\cite{fellbaum1998wordnet}.

\paragraph{Semantic features.} We include the 300-dimensional Google word
embeddings as features \cite{mikolov2013efficient}. 

\paragraph{Hand-crafted features.}
Based on observations of occurrences in Gigaword \cite{citeulike:4789716}, and
descriptions of relational nouns in the literature, we created a hand-crafted
set of 31 features that fire when specific rules are satisfied, based on
sequences of specific lemmas, dependency-tree context, POS-tags, and presence
of named entities (see supplementary material).   

\paragraph{Feature transformations.}
For the count-based features (dependency tree features and sequence features),
we used various encodings: raw counts, counts normalized by the number of
occurrences of the word, the natural log of the normalized counts, and a 0-1
encoding based on whether the count exceeds the $p$th percentile, with $p \in
\{25, 50, 75\}$.

%In many cases, a classifier's performance can be optimized by whitening the
features: scaling and translating each feature to have a standard deviation of
1 and a mean of 0.  We optionally performed whitening on the features.

The count-features (dependency features and sequence features) account for a
very large number of features, so we pruned the count-features down to the top
$k$ features based on mutual information, for $k\times10^{-3} \in \{10, 20, 40,
80\}$.

\subsection{Learning algorithms}
We tested several learners, including support vector machine (SVM), logistic
regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), and random forest (RF).

For the learners having a hyperplane-shaped decision surface (SVM, LR, and NB),
after the learning algorithm finished, we used the training set to translate
the decision surface to optimize F1 to account for the highly imbalanced
training set.

\subsection{Classifier performance}
After optimizing the count-feature representation, learner, learner's
hyperparameters, and ablating features, we found the best performance on the
dev set was achieved using an SVM, with all feature types except morphological
features, $k=80,000$, 
%normalized count representation without whitening,
radial basis function kernel, and hyperparameters $C=100$ and $\gamma=0.001$.  
When run on the test set, this classifier achieved average precision $AP=0.761$
and $F1=0.704$ on the 2500 most common nouns in Gigaword
\cite{citeulike:4789716} and $AP=0.495$ and $F1=0.467$ on randomly sampled
nouns occurring at least 5 times in Gigaword.


%Using the initial set of expert labelled nouns as a dev set, we optimized
feature selection and tuned hyperparameters, optimizing the F1 score.  All
three blocks of features---syntactic, semantic, and morphological---contributed
to improving F1.
%
%We used two learning algorithms based on support vector classifiers (SVC).
The ``categorical'' classifier performs simple three-way classification.  The
``ordinal'' classifier creates two models, one distinguishing \textit{usually
relational} nouns from the others, with the second  distinguishing
\textit{non-relational} nouns from the others.  The final classification is
based on the distance of an example from either hyperplane. 
%
%These classifiers succeed in detect relational nouns with modest profficiency
(\textbf{Table~\ref{table:classifiers}}).  Given that our aim was to use the
classifiers in bootstrapped annotation, to enrich the number of relational
nouns, a more meaningful metric is the proportion of enrichment they achieve.
The best of the two classifiers, which we used to enrich the annotation task,
achieved X\% enrichment.

\section{Existing treatments of relational nouns}
\label{sec:existing-treatments}
As mentioned, relational nouns are nouns that identify an entity by virtue of
how it relates to something else \cite{barker2011possessives}, however, it is
very difficult to apply this definition to decide whether specific nouns are
relational.
While it seems straightforward that kinship nouns like \textit{brother} are
relational, it is less obvious why  \textit{hand} or \textit{speed}, which are
typically held as relational, should be considered as such. And, if we take
\textit{hand} and \textit{speed} to be relational, it would be easy to go
further.

For instance, \newcite{gentner2005relational} has a notion of
\textit{relational categories} with a nearly identical definition, but it is
taken to include \textit{theft}, \textit{bridge}, and \textit{carnivore}---a
much wider class overall.  Since an organism is a carnivore by virtue of eating
animal prey (a relation), how do we conclude that \textit{carnivore} is not a
relational noun but \textit{preditor} and \textit{prey} are?

It will be helpful to consider how relational nouns are treated differently
from other nouns in the semantic analysis of possessives.
Three common possessive constructs are the 
prenominal, postnominal, and predicative possessives
\cite{barker2011possessives,partree2008genitives}:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(2\alph*)},noitemsep]
\item Jill's brother \hfill (prenominal) \quad
\item The brother of Jill \hfill (postnominal) \quad
\item Jill has a brother \hfill (predicative)
\end{enumerate}

Possessive constructs establish a relation between the possessor (e.g. Jill)
and the possessee (brother).  But the content of the relation is in general
extremely malleable \cite{baron2001dimensions}.  This is particularly true for
the prenominal possessive:
\textit{Jill's painting} could mean the painting that Jill bought, the painting
that Jill painted, the painting that Jill is in the process of restoring, etc.

The postnominal possessive is somewhat more restrictive though, and
\newcite{barker2011possessives} asserts that \textit{only} relational nouns can
be the possessee in that case.  For example \textbf{(3a)} seems natural, in
contrast to \textbf{(3b)}:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(3\alph*)},noitemsep]
\item He's the brother of Jill.
\item It's the car of Jill.
\end{enumerate}

While helpful, this diagnostic falls short.  It admits collection-unit
relations that do not involve relational nouns (\textit{pair of shoes},
\textit{audience of children}, \textit{book of spells}).  
%Along similar lines ``made of'' or ``consisting of'' can comfortably be
shortened to ``of'', resulting in, e.g., \textit{a dinner of rice and beans}.
It can be used to refer to part-whole relations that do not involve relational
nouns (\textit{the bucket of the backhoe}).
Moreover, the cases that are purportedly ruled out, such as \textbf{(3b)}, are
perhaps up to stylistic variation \cite{wals-59}, and in any case sound natural
when changed to, e.g., \textit{It's the car of Jill's} which differs only
subtly in its available interpretation \cite{partree2008genitives}.
Nevertheless, even though non-relational nouns can appear in possessives,
relational nouns frequently, perhaps characteristically, arise in possessive
constructs and seem to occupy the postnominal construction more
naturally---which we use to construct a baseline classifier.

As we saw with \textit{Jill's painting}, the prenominal construction is more
malleable in its range of available interpreted relations.  It has been
suggested that one difference between relational and non-relational nouns is
that relational nouns act to constrained the available interpretations for the
prenominal construction
\cite{lichtenberk2011interpretation,laczko2009relational,partree2008genitives}.
Consider the phrase \textit{Jill's brother}, and notice that it is difficult to
interpret any other relation than siblinghood. 
Psycholinguistic experiments show that relational nouns tend to constrain the
interpretation of possessives under changes to the possessor
\cite{lichtenberk2011interpretation}.

This constraint is a matter of degree, and subject to context, however, as
Barker \newcite{barker2011possessives} illustrates with a scenario in which two
journalists have each been assigned to cover one of a pair of
brothers---\textit{John's brother} refers to the brother that John was
assigned, not his sibling.
Furthermore, \textit{non}-relational nouns also constrain the available
interpretations of possessives:
it is difficult to read \textit{the car's wheels} as indicating something other
than the part-whole relation.
While these observations help to define what counts as a relational noun for
the sake of operationalization and annotation, they do not lead obviously to
features for classification.

%Moreover, nouns generally considered relational nevertheless leave a malleable
interpretation of the relation signified by a possessive construct
\cite{lichtenberk2011interpretation}: the relation established by ``Jill's
\textbf{child}'' may be parenthood, or it may be the child that Jill is
teaching, or the child Jill is watching over, etc. 


% JC 4/14: No room to discuss alienability, imho

%Another observed regularity is that relational nouns tend to establish
inalianable relations.
%An inalienable relation is one that is inherent and cannot be disrupted
[CITE].  A typical example is brotherhood: even if Jill's brother dies, he is
still Jill's brother.
%The relations induced by relational nouns under possessives tend to be
inalienable \cite{lichtenberk2011interpretation}.

%But alienability might not be easier to judge than whether a noun is
relational in the first place.  Body parts are seen as being in an inalienable
part-whole relation to the rest of one's body
\cite{laczko2009relational}\footnote{Actually \newcite{baron2001dimensions}
consider body parts to not be relational, but that is not usual.} despite the
fact that body parts can be lost through dismemberment, gained through
prosthesis, or transferred through transplant.  So, particularly in English
where inalienability is ungramaticallized
\cite{lichtenberk2011interpretation}\footnote{Though
\newcite{barker2011possessives} maintains that the postnominal possessive
construction is only availbale for relational nouns and that relational nouns
are identical with inalienable relations, and hence that inalienability
\textit{is} gramaticalized in English.}, alienability is a matter of degree. 
%And many relational nouns invoke alienable relations (\textit{neighbor},
\textit{partner}, \textit{employee}, \textit{classmate}).

Relational nouns have also been characterized as \textit{semantically
unsaturated}, requiring a complement (in the form of the possessor) to be
meaningful
\cite{de1988interpretation,partree2008genitives,laczko2009relational,barker2011possessives}.
Consider the nonsensicality of having a brother who is not the brother
\textit{of someone}. 
But grammatically, the argument is optional for the vast majority of relational
nouns\footnote{There are some relational nouns that characteristically require
a complement (\textit{Jill's sake}), but these seem to be as rare as those that
prohibit binding a compliment by possession (\textit{\# Jill's stranger})
\cite{barker2011possessives}; in the vast majority of cases the so-called
complement seems to be optional; \newcite{de1988interpretation} assert they are
\textit{always} optional.}. Compare \textit{She is a parent} with \textit{She
is a celebrity}.  The case of \textit{parent} (relational) would be treated as
having its argument suppressed by a covert type-shifting operation, which would
not be necessary for the case of \textit{celebrity} (non-relational).
Since arguments are optional and leave no syntactic trace, the notion of
semantic unsaturation serves as a helpful but somewhat nebulous criterion for
annotation, and does not obviously translate into features for classification.

Our final observation for this section is a partial diagnostic described by
\newcite{partree2008genitives}.  Notice that the transformation in
\textbf{(4a)} preserves the original meaning, whereas for relational nouns, as
in \textbf{(4b)}, the transformation induces a slightly changed meaning.


\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(4\alph*)},noitemsep]
\item That is my car $\to$ That car is mine
\item That is my brother $\to$ That brother is mine
\item That is my hand $\to$ That hand is mine.
\item That is my child $\to$ That child is mine.
\end{enumerate}

But for many relational nouns, no such shift in meaning occurs, particularly
ones that are specializations of a part-whole relation \textbf{(4c)} or have
some aspect of ownership or guardianship relation \textbf{(4d)}.

To conclude this section, there are a variety of differences between relational
and non-relational nouns described by semanticists, though they are difficult
to apply due to their subtlety.  This makes both human annotation and automatic
classification challenging.

\section{Conclusions}
In this paper we present the creation of an annotated lexicon of relational
nouns.  
We operationalize the class of relational nouns with consideration for their
usefulness to relation extraction, and use this to guide annotation.  
%The distinction between relational and non-relational nouns is a subtle
semantic one, without any reliable syntactic or morphological cues. As a
result, the annotation of relational nouns is very challenging, with agreement
of only 0.53 (Krippendorff's $\alpha$) among our expert annotators. 
We provide the dataset and classifier model to the research community for
inclusion in relation extraction systems. 

Our work has focused on building a lexicon of nouns which have at least one
sense for which it is relational. Future work could use our lexicon as a
starting point for developing a system which can distinguish between relational
and non-relational readings of such nouns.
